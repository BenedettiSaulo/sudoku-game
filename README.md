## ‚öôÔ∏è Building from Source

If you want to build the project yourself, you'll need the following prerequisites:

* **GraalVM for JDK 21:** [Download here](https://www.graalvm.org/downloads/)
* **Maven 3.8+**
* **Visual Studio Build Tools:** With the "Desktop development with C++" workload installed.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/BenedettiSaulo/sudoku-game.git
    cd sudoku-game
    ```

2.  **Run in Development Mode (Optional):**
    To run the application without creating a native executable:
    ```bash
    mvn gluonfx:run
    ```

3.  **Build the Native Executable:**
    (Make sure you run this from a **Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studio**)
    ```bash
    mvn clean gluonfx:build
    ```

4.  **Find the output:**
    The final application folder will be in `target/gluonfx/x86_64-windows/`.
